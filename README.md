 ## Data Driven Product Management: Conducting a Market Analysis
 
This project is about conducting a comprehensive market analysis for a fitness studio based in Singapore, focusing on the development and placement of digital fitness products in the regional market. As the product manager, my goal was to leverage the data available to inform the strategy for introducing new or improved digital products that cater to the needs and interests of potential users. Here's a breakdown of the project objectives and methods:

### **Objectives:**

**Understand Digital Product Opportunities:** Identify what types of digital fitness products (e.g., apps, online classes, virtual coaching) would be most appealing to your target audience.Understand Digital Product Opportunities: Identify what types of digital fitness products (e.g., apps, online classes, virtual coaching) would be most appealing to your target audience.

**Gauge Market Demand:** Assess the overall interest in fitness-related activities and products, with a particular focus on the regional market around Singapore.

**Competitor Analysis:** Identify the strengths and offerings of competitors to find gaps in the market or areas where your products can differentiate.

**Create Unique Offerings:** Based on the insights gathered, propose new digital fitness products or services that meet unaddressed needs or preferences of potential users.

### **Data and Methods:**

**Data Sources:** A CSV files containing international data from Google Trends and YouTube keyword searches related to fitness. This data will help you understand global and regional trends in fitness interests and preferences.

**Helper Functions:** Two provided functions, read_file and read_geo, assist in loading and visualizing this data. These functions are designed to streamline the process of converting raw data into actionable insights.

**Pandas for Data Exploration:** I will use pandas, a powerful Python library for data analysis, to manipulate and analyze the data. This will include filtering, aggregating, and visualizing data to uncover trends and patterns.

**Further Investigation:** Beyond the digital realm, I am encouraged to consider the broader fitness market, including in-person classes, local gyms, and online personal instructors, to identify additional opportunities or synergies.

### **Steps Involved:**

**Loading and Visualizing Data:** Use the helper functions to load data into pandas DataFrames and generate initial visualizations. This will help you get a sense of the overall trends and the seasonality of interest in fitness-related searches.

**Assessing Demand and Seasonality:** Determine when fitness interest peaks globally and regionally, which can inform timing for product launches or marketing campaigns.

**Keyword Analysis:** By examining specific keywords, identify what fitness topics are most popular, how interest has shifted over time (e.g., during COVID-19), and what content might be missing in the current market.

**Regional Focus:** Focus on Singapore and surrounding regions to understand local preferences and demands, ensuring your digital products are tailored to the market.

**Competitor and Content Analysis:** Identify key competitors and popular fitness content, which can help in developing unique digital products that fill existing gaps or offer something new to the market.

### **Outcome:**
The outcome of this project should be a well-informed strategy for developing and marketing digital fitness products for your studio. By carefully analyzing the data, you'll be able to propose digital products that not only match the interests and needs of your target audience but also position your studio competitively in the fitness market.
